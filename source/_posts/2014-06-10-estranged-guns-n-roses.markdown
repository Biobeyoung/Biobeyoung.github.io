Estranged

U’re talkin' 2 yourself.

And nobody’s home

U can fool yourself.

U came in this world alone.(alone)

So nobody ever told U bady.

How it was gonna be.

So what’ll happen 2 you baby.

Guess we’ll have 2 wait & see.

One two old at heart but I’m only 28.

And I’m too young 2 let love break my heart.

Young at heart,but it’s getting much too late.

To find ourselves so far part.

I don’t know how U’re sposed 2 find me latey

And what more could U from me.

How could U say that I never needed U.

When you took everything.

Said you took everything,baby!

From me young at heart & it gets so hard 2 wait.

When no one I know can seem 2 help me now

Now old at heart but I mustn’t hesitate.

If I’m to find my own way out still.

Talkin’ 2 myself & nobody’s home(alone)

So nobody ever told U bady.

How it was gonna be.

So what’ll happen 2 U baby.

Guess we’ll have 2 wait & see.

When I find all of the reasons.

Maybe I’ll find another way.

Find another day.

With all the changing reason.

Of my life maybe I’ll get it right next time.

And now that U’re been brolen down.

Got Ur head out of the colours.

U’re back down on the groud.

And U don’t talk so lould.

And U don’t walk so proud.

Anymore & what 4 well.

I jumped into the river

Too many times 2 make it home.

I’m out here on my own.

All drifting all alone.

If it doesn’t show.

Give it 2 me 2 read between the lines.

Cause I seee the storm getting close.r

And the waves they get so high.

Seems everything we’ve ever known’s here.

Why must it drift away & die.

I’ll never find anyone 2 replace U.

Guess I’ll have 2 make it true.

This time. Oh ! This time !!

Without U !!

I knew the storm was getting closer.

And all my friends said I said i was high.

But everything we’ve ever known’s here.

I never wanted it 2 die.

中文翻译

伤离

形单影只私语时

四下无人顾

惶惶自欺

茕茕孑立

此行独往身当寂

前途尽是缥缈路

何人曾肯道天机

浮生最是无常事

苦猜度

待天意

韶华当时心已老

纵春光迎面

凭爱摧心碎

青葱年华已难追

忍却步

各分飞

怎堪矫饰做无情

犹恐相逢恰梦醒

何言未曾惜君在

人去也

尽成空……

妄留逝水实非易

举目无相助

光华荏苒岁将暮

遍寻归时路

怎看透

蹊径重新

晨彤又秀

几多年华待从头

痴心呓语收覆水

琢瑕返璞复何求

轻狂少年今何在

云雾散

傲气收

数投沧海寻源处

心魂惟自远漂游

终无言

且为此句

但做静候

狂浪渐高风渐近

倾卷无尽

尽是相识

忍能回首

君自归去欢情短

遗恨犹在

寂寥可堪

我道狂风忽再起

乘云直上九重天

不舍故知遥别去

心虽念

行渐远……
